#How to use

When you open kali.bat the commands will be the same as a regular windows command prompt but if you do the command "dev /on" then you can use kali linux commands then if you do "dev /off it will turn off dev mode"

#Issues
If you use a command that has to have user inputs for example "ping" you do not type the command as "ping 1.1.1.1" you do ping and then 1.1.1.1

#Skidding
If you skid this I dont really care but for the bare minimum please just star the repository
